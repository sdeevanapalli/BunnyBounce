## Game Mechanics ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Carrot**: Represented by the letter `c` on the grid. Can be picked up by the rabbit.
- **Hole**: Represented by the letter `O` on the grid. If the rabbit falls into a hole while carrying a carrot, the carrot is deposited into the hole, removing it from the grid.
- **Movement**: Use the arrow keys to move the rabbit. Press `j` to jump over a hole (if there is a clear pathway on the other side).
